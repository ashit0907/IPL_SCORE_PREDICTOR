# IPL_SCORE_PREDICTOR
This project predicts first-innings IPL scores using historical match data. After preprocessing and encoding features, multiple regression models (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Lasso, SVM, and MLP) are trained and evaluated to understand how factors like teams, venue, overs, and wickets influence the final score.
